## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing much. I feel nonfunctional today. Sometimes I just feel dumb, but I guess that's normal. Anyway, I still manage to learn some Javascript concepts. I also feel like coding something even though it's just as simple as this card. At least it keeps me motivated.
